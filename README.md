O2 Programming Course game - project

The guide to success:

You spawn at the metro station. 
1. Go north and eat lunch.
2. Go to the library. You lose fewer steps if you go through metro station and CHEM building. Return your book.
3. Go east to Dipoli and pass the quiz. Eat the snack you win from the quiz.
4. Go east and buy the PoRa-badge.
5. Go back to library. You will get your badge stolen.
6. Go north to the Undergraduate Center and pass the exam.
7. Search for your badge from other locations if it's not at the Undergraduate Center (the badge is at aBlock, arts, nanotalo, ugCenter or chem).
8. Go back to the metro station.
9. Win the game.

NOTE: Game only works with the TEXTUI
